# How to Contribute

The tools, technology, and approaches we use are always evolving, which means sometimes our documentation can become out of date or incomplete. If you would like to help update these pages, you will need the following:

* A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
* A code editor, such as Visual Studio Code
* Working knowledge of Markdown

This site is built on Material for MkDocs, a Markdown-based documentation platform. All Markdown (and some HTML) is supported, but Material for MkDocs also provides additional Markdown features used in our documentation. We encourage you to check out [their documentation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/) for more information on these features.
