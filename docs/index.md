## Welcome to the Brown Lab Documentation!

This documentation serves as a collection of reference guides for the Brown Lab at Virginia Tech. Here, you will find resources on the analytical tools and techniques most commonly used in the lab to aid your research. These pages aim to be detailed while still broadly applicable to most projects with some adaptation, if needed.

See an issue, or want to help out? Learn [how to contribute](Documentation Guide/contribute.md) and reach out to Jonathan Briganti ([jonbrig@vt.edu](mailto:jonbrig@vt.edu)) to get started.
